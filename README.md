# CloudCoffee
CloudCoffee is a full-stack website built using React for the frontend, CSS for styling, and Node.js for the backend. To make it a bit bigger, the project can be enhanced by expanding its user interface with larger and more visually appealing components, improved typography, and spacious layouts. Additionally, new sections like an “About Us,” “Menu,” or “Contact” page can be added to enrich the user experience and functionality, making the website look more professional, engaging, and feature-rich while maintaining its modern design and responsiveness.
